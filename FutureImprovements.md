# Inheritance improvement

    public PremiumMember(string name, string memberID) : base(name, memberID)
    {
        ExtraBooksLimit = 2; // Premium members can borrow 2 extra books
    }

    public override bool BorrowBook(Book book)
    {
        if (BorrowedBooks.Count >= 3 + ExtraBooksLimit)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Cannot borrow more than allowed books.");
            return false;
        }
        return base.BorrowBook(book);
    }

}

# Suggestions for Improvement:
### Encapsulation:
- Make BorrowedBooks private, and provide methods to access or modify it.
You could introduce more abstraction around the BorrowBook and ReturnBook logic, perhaps encapsulating more of the internal processes or checks.

### Inheritance:
- Introduce inheritance by creating subclasses that extend the Member class. For instance, PremiumMember or StudentMember could have different borrowing rules or benefits.

### Polymorphism:
- Add more polymorphic behavior, such as having different types of library items (Book, Magazine, etc.) that inherit from a common interface or base class like IBorrowableItem, and provide their own implementations for BorrowItem and ReturnItem.
